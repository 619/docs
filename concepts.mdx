# Core Concepts

## Blockchain Architecture

Our blockchain implements a unique architecture combining traditional blockchain features with state channels and zero-knowledge proofs.

### State Channels
State channels allow participants to conduct multiple transactions off-chain while maintaining security guarantees. Only the initial and final states are recorded on-chain.

### ZK-SNARKs Integration
We use ZK-SNARKs to:
- Verify state transitions
- Ensure privacy of intermediate states
- Validate final state computations

## Transaction Types

### Standard Transactions
Traditional blockchain transactions for token transfers and basic operations.

### Stateful Transactions
Our unique implementation allowing for complex multi-step transactions with rollback capabilities.

### Smart Contract Interactions
Support for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, including our specialized stateful contract types.

## Account Model

Our blockchain uses an account-based model with:
- Standard accounts (EOAs)
- Contract accounts
- State channel accounts

## Consensus Mechanism

We implement a hybrid consensus mechanism that:
- Ensures fast finality for standard transactions
- Provides special handling for stateful transaction channels
- Maintains security for complex state transitions
```
