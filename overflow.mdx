# Getting Started

Welcome to the Your Chain documentation. This guide will help you get started with our blockchain platform.

## Quick Install

```bash
npm install @yourchain/sdk
```

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { YourChainSDK } from '@yourchain/sdk';

const sdk = new YourChainSDK({
  endpoint: 'https://rpc.yourchain.com',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});

// Create a new account
const account = await sdk.createAccount();
console.log('New account:', account.address);
```

## Authentication

To use the API, you'll need an API key. You can get one by:
1. Visiting our [developer portal](https://developers.yourchain.com)
2. Creating an account
3. Generating an API key in your dashboard

## Next Steps
- Read about our [core concepts](/concepts)
- Explore the [API reference](/api-reference)
- Check out our [implementation guides](/guides)

# Core Concepts

## Blockchain Architecture

Our blockchain implements a unique architecture combining traditional blockchain features with state channels and zero-knowledge proofs.

### State Channels
State channels allow participants to conduct multiple transactions off-chain while maintaining security guarantees. Only the initial and final states are recorded on-chain.

<img src="/assets/state-channels-diagram.png" alt="State Channels Flow" />

### ZK-SNARKs Integration
We use ZK-SNARKs to:
- Verify state transitions
- Ensure privacy of intermediate states
- Validate final state computations

## Transaction Types

### Standard Transactions
Traditional blockchain transactions for token transfers and basic operations.

### Stateful Transactions
Our unique implementation allowing for complex multi-step transactions with rollback capabilities.

### Smart Contract Interactions
Support for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, including our specialized stateful contract types.

## Account Model

Our blockchain uses an account-based model with:
- Standard accounts (EOAs)
- Contract accounts
- State channel accounts

## Consensus Mechanism

We implement a hybrid consensus mechanism that:
- Ensures fast finality for standard transactions
- Provides special handling for stateful transaction channels
- Maintains security for complex state transitions
```

### api-reference.mdx

# API Reference

## Authentication

All API requests require an API key passed in the headers:

```typescript
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer your-api-key'
}
```

## Endpoints

### Account Management

#### createAccount
```typescript
POST /api/account/create

// Response
{
  address: string,
  privateKey?: string
}
```

[... Include all endpoint documentation from the previous RPC docs artifact ...]

## WebSocket API

Connect to our WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates:

```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://ws.yourchain.com');
```

### Subscription Types
- Block updates
- Transaction confirmations
- State channel updates

## Error Handling

All API errors follow this format:
```typescript
{
  error: true,
  code: string,
  message: string,
  details?: any
}
```

Common error codes:
- `AUTH_ERROR`: Authentication failed
- `INVALID_PARAMS`: Invalid parameters
- `TX_FAILED`: Transaction failed
- `CONTRACT_ERROR`: Smart contract error
```

# Implementation Guides

## Creating Your First Transaction

### 1. Set Up the SDK
```typescript
import { YourChainSDK } from '@yourchain/sdk';
const sdk = new YourChainSDK({
  endpoint: 'https://rpc.yourchain.com',
  apiKey: 'your-api-key'
});
```

### 2. Create and Fund an Account
```typescript
const account = await sdk.createAccount();
// Fund via faucet for testnet
await sdk.requestFunds(account.address);
```

### 3. Send a Transaction
```typescript
const tx = await sdk.sendTransaction({
  to: 'recipient-address',
  value: 1000,
  gasLimit: 21000
});
```

## Working with State Channels

### 1. Initialize a Channel
```typescript
const channel = await sdk.initializeStateChannel({
  participants: ['address1', 'address2'],
  initialState: { balance: { address1: 100, address2: 100 } }
});
```

### 2. Update Channel State
```typescript
await channel.updateState({
  newState: { balance: { address1: 90, address2: 110 } },
  proof: generateStateProof(/* ... */)
});
```

### 3. Finalize Channel
```typescript
await channel.finalize({
  finalState: { balance: { address1: 90, address2: 110 } },
  signatures: [sig1, sig2]
});
```

## Deploying Smart Contracts

### 1. Prepare Contract Code
```typescript
const contract = {
  name: 'MyContract',
  code: contractCode,
  initParams: { owner: account.address }
};
```

### 2. Deploy
```typescript
const deployed = await sdk.deployContract(contract);
```

### 3. Interact with Contract
```typescript
await sdk.callContract({
  address: deployed.address,
  method: 'myMethod',
  params: ['param1', 'param2']
});
```
```
